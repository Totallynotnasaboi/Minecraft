# Minecraft: Python Edition

### Warning: this "game" is trashy

A remake of the popular game of Minecraft. this is not a real game and its pratically unplayable.

This remake was made thanks to the ursina game engine library.
I will try to update the game further to a full fledged game.

#### Installation

To install, clone the repository. You have to have python 3.6+ installed and ursina engine installed.
You can do it like this:

 ` ` `
pip install ursina
  ` ` `

Then just run the python script. If you have a windows machine, you can contribute and compile the actual game with this command (you need to open cmd at the project directory):

` ` `
python -m ursina.build 
` ` `

If you do that, please send me the file so that i can add it to the realeses (and credit you).
